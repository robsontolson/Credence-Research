<p><strong>Market Trends</strong></p>
<p><strong>Innovation in Product Offerings</strong><br /> The brown rice market is seeing innovations such as ready-to-cook brown rice, flavored variants, and fortified brown rice products. These offerings cater to the busy lifestyles of modern consumers and increase the product's appeal. Food companies are also investing in sustainable packaging and sourcing, which further enhances consumer trust and brand loyalty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Market Challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>High Price and Limited Awareness in Rural Areas</strong><br /> Despite growing urban demand, the relatively higher price of brown rice compared to white rice acts as a barrier in price-sensitive markets. Additionally, in many rural or underdeveloped regions, awareness of brown rice's health benefits remains low, and there is resistance to switching from traditionally consumed white rice. These challenges may slow down overall market adoption unless addressed through awareness campaigns and pricing strategies.</p>
