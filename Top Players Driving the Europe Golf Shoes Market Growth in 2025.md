<p><strong>Market Trends</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sustainable and Smart Golf Shoes:</strong><br /> Sustainability is a key emerging trend, with manufacturers focusing on eco-friendly materials like recycled rubber soles and vegan leather alternatives. Smart golf shoes equipped with motion sensors, pressure mapping, and Bluetooth connectivity are also gaining traction, enabling golfers to analyze footwork and performance data.

<p><strong>Market Challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>High Price Sensitivity and Seasonality:</strong><br /> Despite increasing interest in golf, the sport still carries a premium perception in many regions, making price a barrier for casual or first-time buyers.
