<p><strong>Trends and Challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trend &ndash; Integration of Advanced Avionics and AI Systems</strong><br /> One of the key trends in the market is the integration of advanced avionics, artificial intelligence (AI), and electronic warfare systems into older aircraft platforms. These upgrades enable enhanced situational awareness, faster decision-making, and improved mission adaptability. Countries are focusing on extending the operational life of existing fleets while simultaneously adopting digital modernization initiatives, which is driving long-term technological transformation in the sector.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge &ndash; High Costs and Complex Implementation</strong><br /> A major challenge in this market is the high financial burden associated with large-scale modernization programs. Advanced upgrades in avionics, engines, and weapons systems require significant investments, which can strain defense budgets, especially in developing nations. Additionally, technical complexities in integrating new systems with older platforms create delays and operational risks. These cost and implementation hurdles often slow down modernization projects, limiting scalability across the region.</p>
