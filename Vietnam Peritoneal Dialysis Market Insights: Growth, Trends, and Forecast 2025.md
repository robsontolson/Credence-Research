<p><strong>Market Trends</strong></p>
<p><strong>Home-Based Dialysis:</strong><br /> One of the most significant trends in the Vietnamese peritoneal dialysis market is the shift toward home-based dialysis treatments. Patients are increasingly opting for peritoneal dialysis due to its flexibility, convenience, and ability to be performed in the comfort of their own homes. This trend is particularly beneficial in a country like Vietnam, where there is a need to reduce the burden on hospitals and dialysis centers. Furthermore, home-based dialysis offers patients greater autonomy over their treatment schedules, which can lead to improved quality of life and better treatment adherence.</p>
<p><strong>Market Challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>Access and Awareness:<br /> </strong>Despite the positive market trends, there are challenges that may hinder market growth. One of the key challenges is the limited access to peritoneal dialysis treatment in rural areas, where healthcare infrastructure is underdeveloped. Additionally, a lack of awareness among the general population about the benefits of peritoneal dialysis compared to hemodialysis can lead to low adoption rates. Educational programs and outreach initiatives are required to improve patient awareness and access to these life-saving treatments.</p>
