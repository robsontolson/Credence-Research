<p><strong>Market Trends</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technological Integration and AI in Imaging</strong><br /> A key trend shaping the India Digital Radiography Market is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms in imaging systems. AI aids in image interpretation, anomaly detection, and workflow automation, making diagnostic processes more accurate and efficient. The emergence of portable and wireless digital radiography units also aligns with the need for point-of-care diagnostics, particularly in remote regions.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Market Challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>High Initial Investment and Maintenance Costs</strong><br data-start="2901" data-end="2904" /> Despite the benefits, one of the significant challenges is the high initial cost of digital radiography systems and their ongoing maintenance expenses. Smaller hospitals and clinics, especially in Tier II and Tier III cities, may find it financially burdensome to upgrade from analog to digital systems. Additionally, the lack of skilled personnel for operating and maintaining these advanced devices remains a hurdle in widespread adoption.</p>
