# U.S. Peripheral Vascular Devices Market Analysis 2025: Key Trends, Drivers, and Forecast


<p><strong>Market Overview</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/united-states-peripheral-vascular-devices-market">The U.S. Peripheral Vascular Devices Market</a> is projected to grow from USD 2,945.00 million in 2023 to USD 4,947.26 million by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.70%. The market's expansion is largely driven by the increasing prevalence of peripheral artery diseases (PAD), advancements in minimally invasive procedures, and a growing aging population that is more prone to vascular diseases. Peripheral vascular devices, including stents, catheters, balloons, and other diagnostic and therapeutic tools, are essential for treating these conditions, ensuring improved patient outcomes and reduced recovery times. With a steady rise in healthcare investments and the increasing demand for advanced vascular treatments, the market is poised for substantial growth over the forecast period. The surge in healthcare awareness, as well as technological advancements in vascular interventions, is expected to provide further momentum to the market. Moreover, the rising number of ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) and outpatient procedures is likely to contribute significantly to the market's growth.</p>
