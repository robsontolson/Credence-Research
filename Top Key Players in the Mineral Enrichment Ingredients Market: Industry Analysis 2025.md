<p><strong>Market Trends</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personalized Nutrition and Clean Label Products</strong><br /> The growing demand for personalized nutrition is reshaping the market, encouraging the development of customized mineral formulations tailored to individual health needs and demographics. Additionally, consumers are seeking clean-label products that are free from artificial additives and offer transparency in sourcing and composition. This trend pushes brands to innovate with naturally derived mineral sources, enhancing brand trust and market competitiveness.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Market Challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bioavailability and Regulatory Complexity</strong><br /> A key challenge lies in ensuring the bioavailability of minerals post-consumption, as many compounds lose effectiveness during digestion or food processing. Moreover, stringent and varying regulations across regions related to health claims, dosage, and product labeling complicate global expansion and new product launches. These hurdles demand continual investment in formulation technologies and compliance strategies.</p>
