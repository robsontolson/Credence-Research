# Intraoperative Radiation Therapy Systems Market Size & Share Analysis 2024-2032


<p><strong>Market Overview</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/intraoperative-radiation-therapy-systems-market">The Intraoperative Radiation Therapy Systems Market</a> is poised for significant growth, with projections indicating an increase from USD 84.3 million in 2024 to approximately USD 152.59 million by 2032. This growth trajectory reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% from 2024 to 2032, driven by the increasing adoption of advanced medical technologies in the healthcare sector. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is increasingly recognized for its potential in improving cancer treatment outcomes by delivering precise radiation doses directly to the tumor during surgery. The rising incidence of cancer worldwide, coupled with the growing preference for minimally invasive treatments, has led to greater demand for IORT systems. As these systems enable targeted radiation therapy, they reduce the need for multiple treatment sessions, which makes them an appealing option for patients and healthcare providers alike. Furthermore, the integration of IORT systems with other surgical tools and imaging technologies is enhancing their efficacy, boosting the market's expansion. With advancements in IORT techniques, growing cancer prevalence, and the rising focus on improving patient outcomes, the market is expected to maintain a strong growth trajectory over the forecast period.</p>
