<p><strong>Market Drivers</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Rise in Telehealth and E-Pharmacy Platforms:</strong><br /> The proliferation of telehealth and digital pharmacy platforms has transformed how prescriptions are written and delivered. With more patients opting for virtual consultations, there is a growing need for seamless prescription fulfillment services. Prescription delivery complements this shift by ensuring medications are delivered directly to patients&rsquo; homes, enhancing convenience and continuity of care.</li>
<li><strong> Aging Population and Chronic Disease Management:</strong><br /> The global aging population, coupled with a rising prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders, has increased the demand for regular medication. Prescription delivery services offer a reliable solution for elderly and immobile patients who require frequent medication refills, contributing significantly to improved adherence and reduced hospital readmissions.</li>
<li><strong> Increased Focus on Contactless Healthcare Solutions:</strong><br /> The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of contactless and home-based healthcare solutions. Prescription delivery services emerged as a vital channel for minimizing physical contact, ensuring continuity in medication access even during lockdowns. This shift has had a lasting impact on consumer behavior, with growing acceptance of and reliance on delivery-based pharmaceutical services.</li>
