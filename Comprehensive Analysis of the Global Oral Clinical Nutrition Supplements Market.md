<p><strong>Market Trends</strong></p>
<p>A notable trend in the oral clinical nutrition supplements market is the advancement of formulations tailored to specific diseases, age groups, and dietary preferences. Manufacturers are increasingly innovating to create supplements with enhanced taste, better solubility, and improved bioavailability.
