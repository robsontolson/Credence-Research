<p><strong>Trends and Challenges</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Trend: Integration of Smart Technologies and Modular Designs</strong><br /> Retailers are increasingly adopting smart refrigerated display cases integrated with sensors and cloud connectivity to monitor temperature, humidity, and performance metrics in real time. This trend allows for proactive maintenance, ensures compliance with food safety standards, and minimizes product loss. Moreover, modular designs offer flexibility in store layout planning, supporting aesthetic enhancement and space optimization, thereby meeting the evolving needs of retail environments.</li>
<li><strong> Challenge: High Initial Investment and Maintenance Costs</strong><br /> One of the key challenges restraining market growth is the high upfront cost associated with purchasing and installing advanced multi-deck refrigerated display cases. Retailers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, may find it difficult to justify such capital investments. Additionally, ongoing maintenance and energy consumption can be substantial without efficient systems in place, potentially deterring cost-conscious buyers from adopting newer models.</li>
